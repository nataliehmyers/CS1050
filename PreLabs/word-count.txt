Academically, this program satisfies the remainder of my humanities requirement all in one go. The appeal of a three-week trip to a place I have always admired that goes toward my college education is too good to be true. I believe every student could benefit from exploring and experiencing different cultures. It builds perspective and fosters greater understanding and appreciation of foreign peoples, their traditions, and history.
My professional goals are to complete my computer science degree and math minor, then pursue a career in tech startups, preferably in Silicon Valley, near my home town. I intend to build experience through internships during extended university breaks. With any luck, I plan to carry out my career in California for two years following graduation, then moving back here to Columbia, Missouri with my parents when they retire. How does this relate to Greece? Cultural appreciation of diversity in engineering is absolutely key. A trip to Greece may seem unrelated to a computer science major, but any cultural immersion is invaluable to every major and field. One of the most important reasons for my selecting this program over others is my own cultural tie to the region. My father is Middle Eastern, and he grew up swimming in the Mediterranean Sea every day. I have always wanted to visit my fatherâ€™s old home but unfortunately, it has been war-torn since his childhood. Greece is as close as I can get and has several reasons in its own right to attract tourists. I have always been an admirer of historical and archaeological sights. I have a weak spot for antique and vintage artifacts. One of my greatest hobbies is collecting antique books. The opportunity to visit Greece and its historical sites with a group of fellow Mizzou students would be as dream come true.
